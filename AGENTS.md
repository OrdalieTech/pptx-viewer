Dependency graph: `react → core → emf-converter`. Packages use `workspace:*` protocol. Bun workspaces defined at root.

## How the Demos Resolve Packages

The five demo apps are the runtime surface for binding work. Their Vite aliases
do not all resolve packages the same way:

| Specifier                 | React  | Vue    | Angular  | Vanilla | Svelte |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| binding (`pptx-*-viewer`) | source | source | `dist`   | source  | source |
| `pptx-viewer-core`        | source | source | source   | source  | source |
| `pptx-viewer-shared`      | `dist` | source | vendored | source  | source |
| `pptx-viewer-locales`     | source | source | `dist`   | source  | source |
| `pptx-viewer-mcp`         | `dist` | `dist` | `dist`   | `dist`  | `dist` |

Anything marked `dist` needs a rebuild before the demo sees source changes:

- Build `packages/angular` after Angular or shared changes. Angular vendors
  shared source into `src/internal/shared-src` at build time.
- Build `packages/shared` after adding a new shared export used by React.
- Build `packages/tools` after tools changes. A stale tools build can break all
  five demos with a browser compatibility error involving Node's `path` module.

Other demo gotchas:

- A stale Vite server can keep serving old code after a refactor. Confirm the
  process on ports 4173-4177 and restart only the affected server.
- A stale demo `node_modules/.vite` cache can cause framework-internal errors.
  Clear that cache and restart before treating such a stack trace as a source
  regression.
- Demos serve `e2e/fixtures` as their public directory. The landing page can
  also create an editable presentation without a fixture.

## Architecture

### Core Package (`packages/core/src/`)

- **`PptxHandler`** → public facade. Wraps `PptxHandlerCore` → `PptxHandlerRuntime`.
- **Runtime uses mixin composition**: 50+ focused modules in `core/core/runtime/` each add specific capabilities (parsing, saving, theme resolution, etc.) to `PptxHandlerRuntime`.
- **Type system** in `core/types/`: Pure interfaces, no runtime code. `PptxElement` is a discriminated union of 11 element types (`text`, `shape`, `image`, `table`, `chart`, `connector`, `group`, `smartArt`, `media`, `ink`, `ole`). Narrow with `element.type`.
- **Load pipeline**: ArrayBuffer → JSZip → parse XML (fast-xml-parser) → resolve themes/masters/layouts → `PptxData`
- **Save pipeline**: `PptxSlide[]` → serialize elements to OpenXML → rebuild rels/content types → JSZip → `Uint8Array`
- **Theme resolution chain**: Element → Placeholder → Layout → Master → Theme
- **Geometry engine** in `core/geometry/`: 200+ preset shapes, clip paths, connector routing, guide formula evaluation.
- **Converter** in `converter/`: PPTX → Markdown with registry pattern dispatch per element type.

### React Package (`packages/react/src/`)

- **`PowerPointViewer`** is the main component (forwardRef orchestrator).
- **Hooks-based architecture**: 67+ custom hooks handle all logic; components are purely presentational. Key hooks: `useViewerState`, `useEditorHistory`, `useEditorOperations`, `useLoadContent`, `useExportHandlers`, `usePresentationMode`.
- **CSS-based rendering** (not Canvas): Slides render as scaled HTML/SVG with CSS transforms. Charts render as inline SVG. Tables render as HTML `<table>`. Connectors and shapes use SVG `clip-path`.
- **Export** uses html2canvas for rasterization (PNG/PDF/GIF/video).

### EMF Converter (`packages/emf-converter/src/`)

Binary EMF/WMF → GDI record replay onto Canvas 2D → PNG data URL. Supports 300+ EMF record types, EMF+, and legacy WMF.

## Key Conventions

- **Mixin pattern**: Runtime modules are in `PptxHandlerRuntime*.ts` files. Each handles one concern. New capabilities are added as new mixins.
- **Barrel exports**: Every directory has `index.ts`. Import from barrels, not individual files.
- **Type narrowing**: Always use the `type` discriminant for `PptxElement`, e.g. `if (element.type === "image")`.
- **EMU units**: PowerPoint uses English Metric Units internally. Conversion constants in `core/constants.ts` (`EMU_PER_INCH = 914400`, `EMU_PER_POINT = 12700`, `EMU_PER_PIXEL = 9525`).
- **Service interfaces**: Services define `I*` interfaces for DI/testability.
- **File naming**: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for classes. Tests colocated with source (`.test.ts` suffix).
- **File size: keep every source file ≤ 300 LOC.** No `.vue` / `.ts` / `.tsx`
  source file should exceed ~300 lines (tests excluded). When a file approaches
  the limit, **split it out** rather than letting it grow: extract pure logic into
  a focused module, lift sub-views into their own components, and group related
  helpers into their own files. A component SFC that declares its own `interface`s
  or non-trivial computation is a smell; that logic belongs in a composable or a
  shared module, leaving the SFC as thin presentation. Prefer many small,
  single-purpose files over one large one.
- **Share framework-agnostic logic; default to `pptx-viewer-shared`.** The vast
  majority of each binding's code (React/Vue/Angular) is _not_ framework-specific:
  geometry, style/colour/gradient resolution, text/paragraph/bullet building,
  chart/axis maths, connector routing, animation, OMML/LaTeX, export data, etc.
  All of that belongs in **`pptx-viewer-shared`** (`packages/shared/src/render/…`),
  consumed by every binding. Only the actual view layer (SFC templates / JSX /
  Angular templates + the thin reactive wiring) should live in a binding. When
  porting or adding a feature, put the logic in shared **first**, then have each
  binding import it, do not reimplement it per framework. Treat a pure helper
  sitting inside `packages/{vue,react,angular}` as an extraction candidate.
- **No em-dashes; use ASCII punctuation.** Never write the em-dash character
  (`—`, U+2014) anywhere: source, comments, JSDoc, docs/READMEs, commit
  messages, or UI copy. Use a colon, comma, semicolon, parentheses, or a
  spaced hyphen instead, whichever reads naturally. The only
  exception is functional UI/test content that intentionally renders or
  asserts the character (e.g. a `'—'` "no value" marker, a placeholder
  option label). The pre-commit tooling does not catch em-dashes, so keeping
  them out is on you.
- **The pre-commit lint hook skips `.vue` files.** Lint Vue changes explicitly
  before committing because the hook covers only JavaScript and TypeScript
  extensions.
- **Adding an English i18n key requires de/es/fr too.** New entries in
  `packages/shared/src/i18n/translations-en.ts` need matching entries under
  `packages/locales/src/<locale>/`. The locales test enforces full coverage.

## Branching & Git Workflow

This repo uses **trunk-based development**: commit directly to `main`. **Do not
create feature branches unless the user explicitly asks for one.** This overrides
any default "branch before committing" assumption.

> ⚠️ The working tree is sometimes **shared by parallel agent sessions** (e.g.
> the concurrent React / Vue / Angular ports). Another session may switch the
> checkout to its own branch underneath you. Before committing, run
> `git branch --show-current` and `git status` to confirm what you're on. To do
> `main`-branch work without yanking the shared checkout out from under another
> session, push `HEAD:main` (or use an isolated `git worktree`) rather than
> `git checkout main`.

## Commit Conventions

Commits **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
Each published package is versioned and released **independently**: the release
pipeline (`scripts/release-plan.mjs`, run on a schedule / manual dispatch by
`release.yml`, batching everything merged since the previous run) bumps a
package only when files under its directory (or a bundled dependency) change
since its own last `<npm-name>@<version>` tag. **The bump level comes from the
commit types**: a breaking change (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) bumps
major, `feat` bumps minor, everything else bumps patch. It then PREPENDS the
new section to that package's `packages/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md` with
[git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org) (config: `cliff.toml`) scoped to the same
paths, commits the version bumps + changelogs back to main, and cuts a
`<npm-name>@<version>` tag + GitHub release that publishes just that package.
Old tags/releases are culled weekly (`prune-releases.yml`), which is safe only
because changelogs are prepend-only; never regenerate a CHANGELOG.md from tag
history. Non-conforming commits are silently dropped from the changelog, and a
mislabelled type now also mis-bumps the version, so the format is load-bearing,
not cosmetic. Which package(s) a commit lands in is determined by the **paths**
it touches, so keep a commit's changes within one package where practical.

Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **type**: one of `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
  `build`, `ci`, `style`, `chore`, `revert`. These map to changelog sections
  (see `cliff.toml` → `commit_parsers`). `feat`/`fix`/`perf`/`refactor` are
  user-facing; `chore(deps)` groups dependency bumps.
- **scope**: optional, the affected package/area: `core`, `react`, `vue`,
  `shared`, `emf`, `mtx`, `tools`, `ci`, `deps`, etc. Use it; the changelog
  bolds it.
- **subject**: imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period. Keep the first
  line ≤ ~72 chars.
- **breaking changes**: append `!` after the type/scope (`feat(core)!: …`) or
  add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

Examples (from history): `feat(core): typed xml-access helpers`,
`fix(react): remove dead table-cell comparisons`, `chore(deps): update all
dependencies to latest`.

**Authoring tip (tooling):** when committing via a multi-line message, use a
real heredoc or `git commit -F <file>`; do **not** wrap the message in
`@'…'@` (PowerShell here-string syntax); under `bash`/`sh` the stray `@`
characters leak into the subject and break Conventional Commit parsing. End
commit messages with the required `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.
