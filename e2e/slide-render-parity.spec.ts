/**
 * Do the five bindings paint the same slide?
 *
 * Every other spec in this directory asks whether a binding works. This one
 * asks whether it agrees, which is a different and mostly unguarded question:
 * a viewer can pass all of its own tests while rendering a title two points
 * smaller, a shape three percent to the left, or a paragraph in the wrong
 * weight, and nothing fails. Those are precisely the drifts that have shipped
 * here before.
 *
 * The comparison is scale-free (see `support/fingerprint`), so it survives the
 * demos fitting the slide to different chrome, and it is stated once: the
 * harness replays it against React plus whichever bindings this Playwright
 * project owns. Every slide of each deck is fingerprinted, not just the first:
 * the table slide, the chart slide and the media slides are exactly where the
 * bindings have historically drifted.
 *
 * Run: bunx playwright test slide-render-parity
