/**
 * Slide-entry animation STATE coverage against a real PowerPoint deck
 * (`issue-132-hr-deck.pptx`, the 29-slide deck from issue #132), run
 * identically against every framework demo.
 *
 * Pins the three regressions that deck exposed:
 *
 *  1. NO END-STATE FLASH: entering a slide during the show must seed its
 *     entrance-animated elements HIDDEN synchronously with the slide swap.
 *     React used to defer the seed until the slide transition finished and
 *     Angular deferred it by a requestAnimationFrame, so every animated
 *     element painted at its FINAL state for the whole transition (or a
 *     frame), then visibly snapped back to replay.
 *
 *  2. WIPE DIRECTION + GEOMETRY: a `wipe(up)` entrance (presetSubtype 1) must
 *     reveal from the BOTTOM edge, and the reveal must be a CSS `mask` sweep
 *     that COMPOSES with the element's own geometry `clip-path`. The old
 *     `clip-path` keyframes both mapped the subtype to the opposite edge and
 *     replaced the geometry clip, so a thin diagonal stripe wiped in as its
 *     full bounding box (a filled rectangle "blob").
 *
 *  3. FLY-IN DIRECTION: presetSubtype 8 = fly in from the LEFT
 *     (origin-edge bitmask), pinned via the assigned keyframe name.
 *
 * Every assertion reads the rendered DOM through the framework-neutral
 * contract (`#file-input`, `[data-element-id]`, role=button), so the same spec
 * runs against all five bindings.
