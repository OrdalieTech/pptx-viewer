/**
 * Do the five bindings paint the same chart?
 *
 * `e2e/chart-rendering.spec.ts` already asks whether each binding draws *a*
 * chart, per type, with a plausible number of primitives. It cannot ask the
 * question that actually matters here, because it checks each binding against
 * a threshold rather than against the others: two bindings can both satisfy
 * "more than zero bars" while drawing different charts.
 *
 * Charts are the one part of a slide where an exact answer is available.
 * `packages/shared/src/render/chart-view-model.ts` resolves the whole scene -
 * geometry, colours, label text and its typography - into framework-agnostic
 * primitives, and every binding does nothing but paint them. There is no
 * per-binding layout step in between, so the emitted SVG should agree
 * attribute for attribute. Anything that does not is a binding failing to
 * paint what the shared engine handed it, which is exactly the class of drift
 * that a per-binding threshold test cannot see.
 *
 * Run: bunx playwright test chart-svg-parity
