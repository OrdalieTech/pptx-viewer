/**
 * Regression coverage for issue #149, run identically against every framework
 * demo.
 *
 * The reporter compared the issue #130/#131 deck against PowerPoint again and
 * found the word wrap had swapped failure modes between releases: text that
 * used to break a word LATE now broke a word EARLY. Both are the same
 * underlying thing, a text measurement that disagrees with PowerPoint's.
 *
 * PowerPoint lays out with GDI-compatible metrics, snapping every glyph advance
 * to 1/8 point; the browser uses unrounded advances. Per glyph the two differ by
 * up to 1/12 px in EITHER direction, so over a line the disagreement can land
 * either way: COM `BoundWidth` ground truth over this deck has the browser
 * measuring anywhere from 1.07% narrow to 0.28% wide. The first fix applied one
 * flat positive tracking to every run, which is roughly the middle of that
 * range - it tipped the late breaks the right way and pushed every already-wide
 * string over its column, which is what the reporter then saw.
 *
 * The runs now carry a tracking measured from their own characters, so these
 * three pin both directions at once on the same deck:
 *
 *  1. Slide 3's "Explore solution" button (Arial Bold 10pt in a 105px column,
 *     0.8px of slack) stays on ONE line.
 *  2. Slide 12's "Secure Data Movement" chip (Arial Bold 11pt in a 161.5px
 *     column, 0.12px of slack) stays on ONE line.
 *  3. Slide 13's first bullet still breaks after "compositis", the late break
 *     the flat tracking was introduced for (issue #131). This is the constraint
 *     that stops "fix #149" being spelt "revert #131".
