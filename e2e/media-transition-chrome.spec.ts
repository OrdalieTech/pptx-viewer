/**
 * Issue #147: the mystery play icon inside a transition.
 *
 * `solution-explorer.pptx` slide 2 is a wheel painted over a full-bleed
 * background VIDEO (`!!Background`, a `p:pic` carrying `a:videoFile`), and
 * slide 3 arrives on a morph. The reporter caught a play triangle drifting
 * through that transition - faint, centred, and gone by the time the morph
 * landed.
 *
 * It came from the transition overlay, which renders the outgoing slide as a
 * STILL and deliberately passes no media map (a ghost must not mount a second
 * decoder for a video the live stage is already playing). The media renderer
 * therefore took its unplayable-media fallback: poster frame, plus the play
 * badge that goes with it on an authoring canvas. The badge is chrome, not
 * slide content, so a still must not paint it - nor the typed "Media"
 * placeholder box the other bindings would paint in the same spot.
 *
 * The rule now lives in the shared `mediaFallbackVisual`, and every binding
 * stamps `data-pptx-media-chrome` on whatever it paints for it, which is what
 * this spec looks for. The morph is frozen and scrubbed rather than sampled
 * live: the deck asks for `spd="slow"` (1s), far too tight to catch reliably.
 *
 * Run: bunx playwright test media-transition-chrome
