/**
 * Legacy .ppt (PowerPoint 97-2003) import, and its parity with .pptx.
 *
 * Core auto-detects the OLE compound-file container on load and converts the
 * binary deck through the regular pptx pipeline, so a `.ppt` should open from
 * the same `#file-input` as everything else and paint the same slide as its
 * `.pptx` twin (both fixtures were exported from the same deck via PowerPoint
 * COM). Three questions, all framework-neutral:
 *
 *  1. Does a `.ppt` open at all: right slide count, known text rendered, and
 *     the demo's file input actually advertising the extension?
 *  2. Cross-FORMAT parity: does slide 1 loaded from `sample-deck.ppt`
 *     fingerprint identically to slide 1 loaded from `sample-deck.pptx` in the
 *     SAME binding? This reuses the cross-binding fingerprint + diff harness,
 *     re-keyed by content because the two formats share no `data-element-id`s
 *     (see `support/format-parity`).
 *  3. Does the typography-edge-case deck (`text-features.ppt`) survive the
 *     import well enough to render its slide-1 text?
 *
 * Run: bunx playwright test ppt-import-parity
