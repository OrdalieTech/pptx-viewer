/**
 * Issue #161: a shape a morph is not supposed to touch must not move.
 *
 * Jumping between two of this deck's topic slides, the reporter watched the
 * centre panel - a disc, three lines of wording and an "Explore solution"
 * button - shift and resize by about a pixel for the length of the transition
 * and snap back the moment it ended. The disc and the button are byte-identical
 * on both slides, so nothing about them should have been animated at all.
 *
 * They were. The overlay paints a ghost of every outgoing shape drawn over a
 * crossfading backdrop (issue #131), and each ghost carried keyframes - even
 * one whose from-frame and to-frame were the same identity transform. A running
 * animation is not free: the browser gives the shape its own compositing layer
 * and rasterises that layer on whole device pixels, so a box at a fractional
 * position or size is painted up to a pixel smaller and offset until the
 * animation is removed. Measured on the button: 1.2px narrower, 1px shorter.
 *
 * The fix is to paint an inert pair's ghost STATICALLY - it is a pixel-perfect
 * stand-in for the element underneath, so it needs no animation - while still
 * painting it, since it is what keeps the dissolving backdrop from showing
 * through (issue #144 / #146 are the failure modes of dropping it).
 *
 * This measures both halves of that:
 *   1. the copy a viewer actually sees carries no animation, and
 *   2. its painted EDGES land on the same sub-pixel position they occupy on the
 *      settled slide, which is the reporter's symptom stated physically.
 *
 * The morph is frozen and scrubbed rather than sampled in real time - the show
 * runs it in 1s, far too tight to screenshot reliably.
