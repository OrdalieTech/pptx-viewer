/**
 * Does every binding resolve field runs, and against the right slide?
 *
 * An OOXML field run stores the value PowerPoint last displayed alongside the
 * field type, so a viewer that never resolves the field still renders
 * something: `Slide #` instead of `Slide 3`. Nothing looks broken, no element
 * is missing, and every geometry assertion still passes. One binding shipped
 * exactly that.
 *
 * Resolving against the wrong slide fails just as quietly. A viewer that
 * provides one field context built from the *active* slide prints that slide's
 * number and title on every thumbnail in the rail, so the whole pane reads
 * "Slide 3" while showing four different slides. Another binding shipped that.
 *
 * Both need a deck with several slides whose fields resolve to different
 * values, which is why this spec has its own fixture rather than reusing one:
 * on a single-slide deck, resolving against the wrong slide gives the right
 * answer by accident.
 *
 * Run: bunx playwright test field-substitution-parity
