# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## READ FIRST: the two rules that govern every UI change

This repo ships **five** UI bindings (react, vue, angular, svelte, vanilla) over
one framework-agnostic core. Almost every expensive bug in its history came from
breaking one of these two rules. They are not aspirational; they are the
definition of "done" for any work that touches a binding.

### Rule 1: a fix or feature in one binding must reach all five

**Never finish a UI change in a single binding.** If you fix a bug in React, the
same bug is almost certainly present in vue, angular, svelte and vanilla, because
the bindings are ports of each other. Fixing one and stopping is how divergence
gets created, and divergence is the most expensive debt in this repo.

The required loop for **every** UI bug fix:

1. **Diagnose the root cause**, not the symptom. Ask "where does this behaviour
   actually come from?" If the answer is a shared module, one edit fixes all
   five. If the answer is per-binding code, the bug exists five times.
2. **Grep the other four bindings for the same pattern** before declaring the
   fix scoped. Search for the property, class name, helper, or condition you just
   changed across `packages/{react,vue,angular,svelte,vanilla}`.
3. **Fix every affected binding in the same change.** Do not defer four of them
   to "a follow-up"; the follow-up never happens and the drift becomes permanent.
4. **Add a regression test per binding**, plus a framework-neutral spec in `e2e/`
   when the behaviour is observable in a demo.
5. **Verify in the running demos**, not just the unit suites. All five suites
   have been green while a binding was visibly broken, because the defect lived
   in template wiring no unit test covered. See the demo-resolution table below
   (angular needs a build first).
6. **If one binding is genuinely blocked, say so explicitly** and file a tracking
   issue. Silently fixing one binding is the failure mode.

Assume a UI bug is structural until proven otherwise. "Genuinely
framework-specific" means Angular change detection, Svelte 5 runes, React effect
ordering, and the like. A wrong colour, a mis-clipped shape, an off-by-one drag
handle, or a dialog that will not open is almost never framework-specific.

### Rule 2: take every opportunity to extract logic into `pptx-viewer-shared`

When you touch logic in a binding, **ask whether it belongs in
`packages/shared/src/render/` instead**, and move it there if it does. This is
not a cleanup task to schedule later; it is how the parity rule above is made
cheap. Logic that lives in shared is fixed once for all five bindings, and never
drifts.

Extraction triggers, any one of which means stop and extract:

- You are about to make the same edit in more than one binding.
- You are porting a fix from one binding to the others.
- You find a pure helper (no framework imports) sitting inside
  `packages/{react,vue,angular,svelte,vanilla}`.
- You are writing new logic for a feature that all five bindings will need.

The target shape is a **pure decision function**: shared exports a function that
returns a framework-neutral descriptor, and the binding does nothing but map that
descriptor onto its own style object or template. Following that shape, a new
branch reaches all five bindings at once.

Both rules are expanded, with the concrete failures that motivated them, under
[Key Conventions](#key-conventions).

```

Build order matters: **emf-converter → mtx-decompressor → core → react**

## Monorepo Structure

```
packages/
  core/             pptx-viewer-core     – Parse, edit, serialize PPTX (framework-agnostic)
  shared/           pptx-viewer-shared   – Framework-agnostic viewer logic (INTERNAL, bundled into each binding, never published)
  react/            pptx-viewer          – React viewer/editor component
  react-compat/     (private, no build)  – React 18 peer set; `packages/react` aliases onto it to
                                           re-run its whole suite + declaration check against the
                                           older supported major (`bun run test:react18`)
  vue/              pptx-vue-viewer      – Vue 3 viewer/editor component
  angular/          pptx-angular-viewer  – Angular viewer/editor component
  vanilla/          pptx-vanilla-viewer  – Zero-framework (VanillaJS) viewer
  svelte/           pptx-svelte-viewer   – Svelte 5 viewer component
  emf-converter/    emf-converter        – EMF/WMF metafile → PNG converter
  mtx-decompressor/ mtx-decompressor     – MicroType Express font decompressor
  tools/            pptx-viewer-mcp      – MCP server / tooling
demos/
  demo-react/       Vite + React demo app  (port 4173)
  demo-vue/         Vite + Vue 3 demo app  (port 4175)
  demo-angular/     Vite + Angular demo app (port 4174)
  demo-vanilla/     Vite + VanillaJS demo app (port 4176)
  demo-svelte/      Vite + Svelte 5 demo app (port 4177)
```

Dependency graph: `react → core → emf-converter`. Packages use `workspace:*` protocol. Bun workspaces defined at root.

## How the Demos Resolve Packages (read before debugging one)

The five demo apps are the runtime surface for binding work. Each demo's
`vite.config.ts` aliases bare package specifiers, but **not uniformly**, and the
difference decides whether your edit is live on reload or needs a build first.

| Specifier                     | react      | vue        | angular      | vanilla    | svelte     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| the binding (`pptx-*-viewer`) | source     | source     | **`dist`**   | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-core`            | source     | source     | **`dist`**   | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-shared`          | **`dist`** | source     | **vendored** | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-locales`         | source     | source     | **`dist`**   | source     | source     |
| `pptx-viewer-mcp`             | **`dist`** | **`dist`** | **`dist`**   | **`dist`** | **`dist`** |

Anything marked `dist` resolves through the workspace `exports` field to built
output, so **source edits are invisible until you build that package**:

- **Angular**: `pptx-angular-viewer` is built by ng-packagr, so the demo reads
  `packages/angular/dist`. Editing `packages/angular/src` changes nothing on
  screen until `bun run build` in `packages/angular`. This is the single most
  common way to waste an hour concluding "my change doesn't work in Angular".
  Angular also vendors shared source into `src/internal/shared-src` at build
  time, so shared edits need the same rebuild. **Its `pptx-viewer-core` is
  `dist` too**: the demo never aliases core, unlike the other four, so a core
  edit needs `bun run --filter pptx-viewer-core build` before this demo sees it
  at all. Core is also in the demo's `optimizeDeps.include`, so vite pre-bundles
  it into `demos/demo-angular/node_modules/.vite/deps/pptx-viewer-core.js`; that
  copy normally re-optimises when core's dist changes, but it has been observed
  serving a stale core anyway (a long-running server on Windows, where the
  watcher does not always see writes through the workspace symlink). If Angular
  alone disagrees with the other four demos, delete that demo's
  `node_modules/.vite` and restart before suspecting your code.
  `e2e/dist-freshness.ts` checks both axes before every e2e run.
- **`pptx-viewer-mcp`** (`packages/tools`) is aliased by no demo. It is reachable
  from the browser because `packages/shared/src/ai/tools/mcp-registry.ts` imports
  it, so a **stale `packages/tools/dist` breaks all five demos at once** with
  `Module "path" has been externalized for browser compatibility`. The giveaway
  is a demo that renders only its version footer. Fix with `bun run build` in
  `packages/tools`.
- **`pptx-viewer-shared`**: after adding a NEW export, run `bun run build` in
  `packages/shared` once, or the React and Angular demos will not see it.

Other demo gotchas:

- **Zombie vite servers** keep serving stale code after a refactor. Check with
  `netstat -ano | grep -E ":(4173|4174|4175|4176|4177) .*LISTENING"`, and if
  behaviour contradicts the source, kill the PID and relaunch rather than
  debugging the code.
- **Stale vite dep caches** cause bogus framework-internal crashes. A stale
  `demos/demo-svelte/node_modules/.vite` threw a "Cannot read properties of
  undefined" error from inside Svelte's own runtime and stopped decks rendering
  entirely. Delete the demo's `node_modules/.vite` and restart before believing
  a stack trace that points into a framework.
- **A demo that never renders is usually a cached resolution failure, not your
  code.** Vite caches a FAILED import resolution, so a module added while the
  server was running keeps 500-ing after the file exists on disk and is
  committed. The tell is that every e2e test times out on `#file-input` at once
  while the page itself returns HTTP 200: the shell serves, the app never
  mounts. Diagnose by checking which port actually 500s rather than assuming the
  suite found a real regression:
  `curl -s http://localhost:4176/@fs/<abs-path>/packages/shared/src/render/index.ts`
  names the unresolved import. Then kill that port, delete that demo's
  `node_modules/.vite`, and restart it. This has masked "all parity specs
  failed" more than once; four of five demos being healthy is the clue.
- **Rebuilding `packages/angular/dist` breaks the running Angular demo.** It
  starts 404-ing on its own CSS and its vite pre-bundle of core goes stale
  (`e2e/dist-freshness.ts` checks that second axis separately and tells you to
  clear it). After any `bun run --filter pptx-angular-viewer build`, kill :4174,
  `rm -rf demos/demo-angular/node_modules/.vite`, and restart before running
  e2e.
- The demos serve `e2e/fixtures` as their public dir, and the landing page's
  "or create a New Presentation" button gives an editable deck without a file.

## Architecture

### Core Package (`packages/core/src/`)

- **`PptxHandler`** → public facade. Wraps `PptxHandlerCore` → `PptxHandlerRuntime`.
- **Runtime uses mixin composition**: 50+ focused modules in `core/core/runtime/` each add specific capabilities (parsing, saving, theme resolution, etc.) to `PptxHandlerRuntime`.
- **Type system** in `core/types/`: Pure interfaces, no runtime code. `PptxElement` is a discriminated union of 11 element types (`text`, `shape`, `image`, `table`, `chart`, `connector`, `group`, `smartArt`, `media`, `ink`, `ole`). Narrow with `element.type`.
- **Load pipeline**: ArrayBuffer → JSZip → parse XML (fast-xml-parser) → resolve themes/masters/layouts → `PptxData`
- **Save pipeline**: `PptxSlide[]` → serialize elements to OpenXML → rebuild rels/content types → JSZip → `Uint8Array`
- **Theme resolution chain**: Element → Placeholder → Layout → Master → Theme
- **Geometry engine** in `core/geometry/`: 200+ preset shapes, clip paths, connector routing, guide formula evaluation.
- **Converter** in `converter/`: PPTX → Markdown with registry pattern dispatch per element type.

### React Package (`packages/react/src/`)

- **`PowerPointViewer`** is the main component (forwardRef orchestrator).
- **Hooks-based architecture**: 67+ custom hooks handle all logic; components are purely presentational. Key hooks: `useViewerState`, `useEditorHistory`, `useEditorOperations`, `useLoadContent`, `useExportHandlers`, `usePresentationMode`.
- **CSS-based rendering** (not Canvas): Slides render as scaled HTML/SVG with CSS transforms. Charts render as inline SVG. Tables render as HTML `<table>`. Connectors and shapes use SVG `clip-path`.
- **Export** uses html2canvas for rasterization (PNG/PDF/GIF/video).

### EMF Converter (`packages/emf-converter/src/`)

Binary EMF/WMF → GDI record replay onto Canvas 2D → PNG data URL. Supports 300+ EMF record types, EMF+, and legacy WMF.

## Key Conventions

- **Mixin pattern**: Runtime modules are in `PptxHandlerRuntime*.ts` files. Each handles one concern. New capabilities are added as new mixins.
- **Barrel exports**: Every directory has `index.ts`. Import from barrels, not individual files.
- **Type narrowing**: Always use the `type` discriminant for `PptxElement`, e.g. `if (element.type === "image")`.
- **EMU units**: PowerPoint uses English Metric Units internally. Conversion constants in `core/constants.ts` (`EMU_PER_INCH = 914400`, `EMU_PER_POINT = 12700`, `EMU_PER_PIXEL = 9525`).
- **Service interfaces**: Services define `I*` interfaces for DI/testability.
- **File naming**: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for classes. Tests colocated with source (`.test.ts` suffix).
- **File size: keep every source file ≤ 300 LOC.** No `.vue` / `.ts` / `.tsx`
  source file should exceed ~300 lines (tests excluded). When a file approaches
  the limit, **split it out** rather than letting it grow: extract pure logic into
  a focused module, lift sub-views into their own components, and group related
  helpers into their own files. A component SFC that declares its own `interface`s
  or non-trivial computation is a smell; that logic belongs in a composable or a
  shared module, leaving the SFC as thin presentation. Prefer many small,
  single-purpose files over one large one.
- **Share framework-agnostic logic; default to `pptx-viewer-shared`.**
  (Rule 2 above; the extraction triggers are listed there.) The vast
  majority of each binding's code (React/Vue/Angular) is _not_ framework-specific:
  geometry, style/colour/gradient resolution, text/paragraph/bullet building,
  chart/axis maths, connector routing, animation, OMML/LaTeX, export data, etc.
  All of that belongs in **`pptx-viewer-shared`** (`packages/shared/src/render/…`),
  consumed by every binding. Only the actual view layer (SFC templates / JSX /
  Angular templates + the thin reactive wiring) should live in a binding. When
  porting or adding a feature, put the logic in shared **first**, then have each
  binding import it, do not reimplement it per framework. Treat a pure helper
  sitting inside `packages/{vue,react,angular}` as an extraction candidate.
  - **The shape to aim for is a pure decision function.** Shared exports a
    function returning a framework-neutral _descriptor_; the binding only maps
    that descriptor onto its own style object / template. Existing examples:
    `presentation-keymap` (`mapPresentationKey`), `connector-hit-target`,
    `hollow-shape-hit-test`, `shape-geometry-cascade`. Following that shape, a
    new branch reaches all five bindings at once.
  - **"I am making the same edit in N bindings" is the extraction signal.** Not
    a nuisance to push through: stop and extract. Small tails are the dangerous
    ones, because each copy looks trivial in isolation and nobody diffs five
    files that all look fine. The shape-geometry cascade was hand-ported five
    times, and Angular silently drifted: it compared `shapeType` **raw**
    (`=== 'ellipse'`) instead of via `getShapeType`, so `oval` - a preset in the
    shape picker - and every capitalised spelling missed the branch, and it had
    no connector/line/cylinder branch at all.
  - **Normalise before you branch.** Compare against `getShapeType(...)`, never
    a raw `shapeType` string: the normaliser folds aliases (`oval`->`ellipse`,
    `can`->`cylinder`) and lowercases. A raw compare is the single most common
    way a binding drifts.
  - **A shared value can be clobbered downstream.** Setting a property in a
    shared style map does not mean it survives: a binding may spread that map
    and then override the very property (Svelte's `ElementRenderer` re-sets
    `pointerEvents` from its own interactive flag). After adding a
    behaviour-bearing style in shared, grep each binding for that property.
  - **Per-binding unit tests passing does NOT mean the binding works.** All five
    suites were green while Svelte was still visibly broken, because the defect
    lived in template wiring no unit test covered. Load the deck in each demo
    and verify the actual behaviour (see the demo-resolution table above; Angular
    needs a build first).
- **UI changes must reach all five bindings.** (Rule 1 above; the required
  bug-fix loop is listed there.) This is a merge requirement, not
  a nice-to-have: a user on Svelte is entitled to the feature set a user on
  React gets, and divergence between bindings is the most expensive debt in this
  repo.
  - **A new UI feature** (ribbon control, dialog, inspector panel, context-menu
    entry, keyboard shortcut, gesture, on-canvas affordance) is not done when it
    works in React. Put the logic in `pptx-viewer-shared`, then implement the
    view layer in **react, vue, angular, svelte, and vanilla**, with unit tests
    per binding and a framework-neutral spec in `e2e/`.
  - **A UI fix** must be checked against the other four bindings before it is
    called finished. Most UI bugs here are structural (they came from a shared
    module, or four bindings made the same porting mistake), so the same defect
    usually exists elsewhere. Fix every affected binding in the same change and
    add a regression test to each. If one is genuinely blocked, say so
    explicitly and file a tracking issue: silently fixing one binding is what
    causes the drift.
  - **Prefer fixing a UI bug in shared over fixing it five times.** When the
    buggy behaviour is decided by logic that could live in
    `packages/shared/src/render/`, move it there as part of the fix so the
    correction lands once and cannot drift again. A bug you are about to patch
    in more than one binding is the strongest possible extraction signal.
  - "Genuinely framework-specific" means Angular change detection, Svelte 5
    runes, React effect ordering, and the like. A wrong colour, a mis-clipped
    shape, an off-by-one drag handle, or a dialog that does not open is almost
    never framework-specific.
  - See `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the parity rule + decision table) for the version
    external contributors are held to.
- **No em-dashes; use ASCII punctuation.** Never write the em-dash character
  (`—`, U+2014) anywhere: source, comments, JSDoc, docs/READMEs, commit
  messages, or UI copy. Use a colon, comma, semicolon, parentheses, or a
  spaced hyphen instead, whichever reads naturally. The only
  exception is functional UI/test content that intentionally renders or
  asserts the character (e.g. a `'—'` "no value" marker, a placeholder
  option label). The pre-commit tooling does not catch em-dashes, so keeping
  them out is on you.
- **The pre-commit lint hook skips `.vue` files.** Its glob covers only the
  js/ts extensions, so an oxlint warning inside a `.vue` SFC sails through the
  hook and fails `bun run lint` later. Lint Vue changes explicitly before
  committing.
- **Adding an English i18n key requires de/es/fr too.** New entries in
  `packages/shared/src/i18n/translations-en.ts` need matching entries under
  `packages/locales/src/<locale>/`; `packages/locales/src/locales.test.ts`
  enforces that every locale covers every canonical key.

## Branching & Git Workflow

This repo uses **trunk-based development**: commit directly to `main`. **Do not
create feature branches unless the user explicitly asks for one.** This overrides
any default "branch before committing" assumption.

> ⚠️ The working tree is sometimes **shared by parallel agent sessions** (e.g.
> the concurrent React / Vue / Angular ports). Another session may switch the
> checkout to its own branch underneath you. Before committing, run
> `git branch --show-current` and `git status` to confirm what you're on. To do
> `main`-branch work without yanking the shared checkout out from under another
> session, push `HEAD:main` (or use an isolated `git worktree`) rather than
> `git checkout main`.

## Commit Conventions

Commits **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
Each published package is versioned and released **independently**: the release
pipeline (`scripts/release-plan.mjs`, run on a schedule / manual dispatch by
`release.yml`, batching everything merged since the previous run) bumps a
package only when files under its directory (or a bundled dependency) change
since its own last `<npm-name>@<version>` tag. **The bump level comes from the
commit types**: a breaking change (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) bumps
major, `feat` bumps minor, everything else bumps patch. It then PREPENDS the
new section to that package's `packages/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md` with
[git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org) (config: `cliff.toml`) scoped to the same
paths, commits the version bumps + changelogs back to main, and cuts a
`<npm-name>@<version>` tag + GitHub release that publishes just that package.
Old tags/releases are culled weekly (`prune-releases.yml`), which is safe only
because changelogs are prepend-only; never regenerate a CHANGELOG.md from tag
history. Non-conforming commits are silently dropped from the changelog, and a
mislabelled type now also mis-bumps the version, so the format is load-bearing,
not cosmetic. Which package(s) a commit lands in is determined by the **paths**
it touches, so keep a commit's changes within one package where practical.

Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- **type**: one of `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
  `build`, `ci`, `style`, `chore`, `revert`. These map to changelog sections
  (see `cliff.toml` → `commit_parsers`). `feat`/`fix`/`perf`/`refactor` are
  user-facing; `chore(deps)` groups dependency bumps.
- **scope**: optional, the affected package/area: `core`, `react`, `vue`,
  `shared`, `emf`, `mtx`, `tools`, `ci`, `deps`, etc. Use it; the changelog
  bolds it.
- **subject**: imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period. Keep the first
  line ≤ ~72 chars.
- **breaking changes**: append `!` after the type/scope (`feat(core)!: …`) or
  add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

Examples (from history): `feat(core): typed xml-access helpers`,
`fix(react): remove dead table-cell comparisons`, `chore(deps): update all
dependencies to latest`.

**Authoring tip (tooling):** when committing via a multi-line message, use a
real heredoc or `git commit -F <file>`; do **not** wrap the message in
`@'…'@` (PowerShell here-string syntax); under `bash`/`sh` the stray `@`
characters leak into the subject and break Conventional Commit parsing. End
commit messages with the required `Co-Authored-By:` trailer.

**Never include a Claude chat share link.** Do not add a `claude.ai/chat/...`
(or any other Claude conversation) URL to a commit message, PR body, issue
comment, changelog entry, code comment or doc. Those links are session-scoped
and mean nothing to a reader of this repository. The `Co-Authored-By:` trailer
is the only attribution that belongs in a commit.
