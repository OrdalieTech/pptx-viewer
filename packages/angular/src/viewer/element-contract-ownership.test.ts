/**
 * Exactly one DOM node per slide element may own the element contract.
 *
 * The contract (`data-element-id` + `data-pptx-element="true"` + the shared
 * ARIA role / label) is applied by the slide canvas, which looks each element
 * up by `data-element-id`. When a leaf renderer stamped that id on its OWN root
 * INSIDE the dispatcher's already-marked wrapper, the lookup found the inner
 * node instead: it carried no marker, kept its own `role="img"` and its own
 * label, and the positioned box was drawn twice (both roots applied
 * `getContainerStyle`, so the OLE / SmartArt box was offset by its x/y twice).
 *
 * Angular has no TestBed here (see `vitest.config.ts`), so the guard reads the
 * component sources: leaf renderers that are drawn INTO a host-owned box must
 * not claim the id, and the hosts that draw that box must.
