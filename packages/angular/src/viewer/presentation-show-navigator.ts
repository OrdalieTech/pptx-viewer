/**
 * presentation-show-navigator.ts: the slide show's navigation state machine.
 *
 * "Which slide is up" is not a single number in PowerPoint's model: a forward
 * step may reveal the next animation build instead of changing slide, a
 * backward step may replay the current slide's builds instead of leaving it,
 * running off the end raises an end-of-show screen rather than wrapping, and an
 * authored `p:transition/@advTm` arms a timer that must be re-armed (and
 * cancelled) on every change. That is a state machine, and it was previously
 * interleaved with DOM wiring, keyboard handling and template plumbing inside
 * {@link PresentationOverlayComponent}.
 *
 * It lives here as a plain signal-holding class (no Angular injection context
 * needed) so the component keeps only the view wiring, and so the rules above
 * can be read in one place.
