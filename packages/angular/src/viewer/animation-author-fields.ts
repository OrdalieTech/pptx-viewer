/**
 * animation-author-fields.ts: maps each control in the animation authoring panel
 * to the shared `set*` patch builder behind it.
 *
 * The panel had fourteen near-identical handlers, one per control, each of them
 * "read the value off the event, bail if it is not usable, call the matching
 * shared setter, emit the new list". That is copy-paste, and copy-paste is how a
 * control quietly ends up with the wrong guard: they had already drifted into
 * three different bail conditions for the same `<select>` shape. Collapsing them
 * to two dispatch tables means the panel keeps exactly ONE select handler and
 * ONE number handler, and adding a control is a row here rather than another
 * copied method.
 *
 * The setters themselves stay in `pptx-viewer-shared` (re-exported through
 * `animation-author-helpers.ts`); this file only names them.
