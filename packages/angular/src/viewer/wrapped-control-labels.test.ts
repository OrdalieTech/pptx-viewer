/**
 * No `<select>` may leave its naming to the `<label>` that wraps it.
 *
 * A control nested inside its label has no accessible name of its own, so a
 * label-text consumer reads the label element's WHOLE text content instead -
 * and once the options are nested in there too, that text is the caption plus
 * every option. The transition picker announced itself as "Transition None Cut
 * Fade ... Rotate ...", and a slide-show spec hunting for a rotate handle
 * matched it instead.
 *
 * Angular cannot render a component in this suite (no TestBed: see
 * `vitest.config.ts`), so the accessible NAME itself is asserted in
 * `e2e/connector-arrows.spec.ts` ('every control names itself instead of
 * borrowing its option list'), which drives the real Angular demo in a real
 * browser. What this test adds is breadth: it holds the whole binding to the
 * rule rather than the handful of controls a spec happens to click, which is
 * how the 21 Angular sites drifted in the first place.
