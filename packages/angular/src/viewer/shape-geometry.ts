/**
 * Shape-geometry clip-path helper (thin re-export shim).
 *
 * The preset clip-path cascade (adjustment-aware -> ECMA-376 preset evaluator
 * -> cloud Bezier -> core's static `getShapeClipPath` table) is implemented
 * once in `pptx-viewer-shared` (`render/shape-geometry.ts`) and vendored into
 * this library via `../internal/shared`. This module re-exports the shared
 * implementation under the names the Angular viewer already consumes, so
 * existing imports keep working without a local duplicate.
