	 * ever moving the pointer is a different browser-native event with no
	 * handler in its way, and it bubbles looking for a listener. Nested inside
	 * `ElementRenderer`'s own div (the pre-existing structure) that listener
	 * was the shape's own; hosted here, as a stage-level sibling, it is not.
	 * `SlideCanvas`'s stage-level delegation (`getElementIdFromEvent`) cannot
	 * stand in for it either: it resolves an event's element by walking up to
	 * the nearest `data-pptx-element="true"` ancestor, and this host is
	 * deliberately NOT marked that way (see the render below), so without this
	 * explicit forward a right-click landing on the overlap missed the shape's
	 * menu entirely (`context-menu-parity.spec.ts`: "Escape and an outside
	 * click both dismiss the menu", the reopen step).

/**
 * Resize / rotate / adjustment handles for the single selected element,
 * mounted as a STAGE-level sibling of `ElementRenderer` (in `SlideCanvas`,
 * alongside `ConnectorEndpointOverlay` and `MotionPathOverlay`) rather than
 * as its child.
 *
 * `ElementRenderer`'s own container carries the preset's `clip-path`
 * (`shapeVisualStyle`'s clipPath cascade, e.g. for `rightArrow`) so a click in
 * a non-rectangular shape's dead space falls through to whatever is behind
 * it, matching PowerPoint. `clip-path` excludes every DESCENDANT from
 * hit-testing wherever it falls outside the polygon, not just from paint, and
 * there is no per-descendant CSS escape from an ancestor's clip. An
 * adjustment handle is deliberately measured onto a preset geometry VERTEX
 * (PowerPoint's own convention), and for a preset like `rightArrow` that
 * vertex sits exactly on a sharp convex corner of the clip polygon, so a
 * handle nested inside the clipped container had roughly half its hit area,
 * including its own centre, excluded from hit-testing (confirmed via
 * `document.elementFromPoint` at the handle's centre: the click landed on an
 * unrelated shape's text behind it instead of the handle). Hosting every
 * handle here, unclipped, fixes that uniformly rather than only for the one
 * preset a spec happens to catch it on.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch `ElementRenderer`'s own container div: that
 * div's class/style pointer-events rules make exactly the shape's own
 * silhouette clickable (hollow-shape frames, presentation hit-testing, action
 * shapes), which is a different, unrelated concern from where the shape's
 * auxiliary handle UI paints.
 *
 * Not used for connectors: `ConnectorElementRenderer` renders its own
 * (unclipped) `ResizeHandles` internally, since a connector has no fill/clip
 * to escape.
