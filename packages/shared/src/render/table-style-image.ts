/**
 * table-style-image.ts - resolve a table cell's image fill (`a:tcPr/a:blipFill`)
 * to CSS.
 *
 * A table cell filled with an image parsed to no fill at all before this
 * module existed: `applyCellFillStyle` (core) had no `a:blipFill` branch, so
 * `PptxTableCellStyle.fillMode` never became `'image'`. Now that the core
 * parser resolves the blip relationship to a path (see
 * `backgroundImageFillPath` / `backgroundImageFillData` on
 * {@link PptxTableCellStyle}), this is the one place that path becomes CSS,
 * consumed by {@link cellStyleToCss} (and, through it, `tableCellCss`) so all
 * five bindings render it identically.
 *
 * Table parsing is synchronous, so the archive-relative path is resolved
 * lazily by the viewer's load pipeline (mirroring picture elements parsed
 * with `eagerDecodeImages: false`): `backgroundImageFillPath` starts out as a
 * raw archive path, which is not a usable CSS `url()`, and is patched to
 * `backgroundImageFillData` (a `data:`/`blob:` URL) once resolved. An
 * already-external `http(s):`/`data:` target is usable immediately from
 * either field.
