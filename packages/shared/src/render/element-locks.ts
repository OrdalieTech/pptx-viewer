/**
 * `element-locks`: whether an authored `a:spLocks` lets a gesture proceed.
 *
 * PowerPoint stores per-shape interaction locks on the non-visual properties
 * node (`p:cNvSpPr/a:spLocks`, and the `a:cxnSpLocks` / `a:picLocks` /
 * `a:grpSpLocks` / `a:graphicFrameLocks` variants), and the parser folds all of
 * them into one {@link PptxShapeLocks} bag on the element. A locked shape in a
 * real deck is a template guardrail: the author is saying "the reader may not
 * drag this masthead off the slide".
 *
 * Enforcement used to be spread across the bindings by hand, which is how the
 * repo ended up shipping a Lock button in the Vue and Angular inspectors that
 * wrote `locks` nothing on the canvas ever read. This module is the single
 * decision function: give it an element and it returns a framework-neutral
 * descriptor of what the user may still do to it, and every binding maps that
 * descriptor onto its own pointer wiring.
 *
 * Composition rules (PowerPoint's, not ours):
 *  - `noSelect` subsumes everything. A shape you cannot select is a shape you
 *    cannot move, resize, rotate, adjust or edit, whatever the other flags say.
 *  - every other flag gates exactly one gesture, so a shape can be pinned in
 *    place (`noMove`) and still be resized, which is what PowerPoint does.
 *
