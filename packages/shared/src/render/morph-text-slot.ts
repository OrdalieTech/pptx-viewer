/**
 * Whether a matched pair of TEXT BOXES holds different wording in the same slot.
 *
 * Such a pair is animated as a pure dissolve: no translation, no scale, each
 * half painted at its own geometry with complementary opacity. Everywhere else
 * a matched pair interpolates its whole box, which is right for a shape - but a
 * text box's box is a container that PowerPoint re-fits around whatever it now
 * says, and its glyphs are laid out inside that box rather than scaled with it.
 * Interpolating it therefore stretches the wording by the amount the WORDS
 * changed length, which is never something PowerPoint shows.
 *
 * Measured on PowerPoint 16's own render (`CreateVideo`, 62.5fps):
 *
 *   - A text box whose wording changed while its box doubled in width dissolves
 *     glyph over glyph with the type at a constant size, still on its left
 *     margin: the box grew, the text did not.
 *   - The wheel deck's centre paragraphs (issue #160) re-fit by 11px and 12px
 *     between topic slides. Every frame of PowerPoint's transition is a blend of
 *     the two end states with a residual under 1.1/255, which no scaling or
 *     shifting of either half could produce.
 *   - A text box that genuinely MOVES (460px, wording changed too) travels the
 *     whole way while its glyphs cross-dissolve, so distance has to keep the
 *     interpolation. Hence the slot test rather than a blanket rule.
 *
 * @param fromElement - The outgoing half of the pair.
 * @param toElement - The incoming half.
 * @returns True when the pair should dissolve where it stands.
