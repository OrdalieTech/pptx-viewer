/**
 * Who is allowed to hide whom during a morph.
 *
 * A morph is played as two stacked layers: the live stage draws the INCOMING
 * slide, and a transition overlay above it paints ghosts of the outgoing one
 * (see `morph-plan`). That split is only faithful while every ghost genuinely
 * belongs on top of everything the stage is drawing. It does not, in general:
 * PowerPoint composites one merged scene, in which an object arriving on the
 * incoming slide can perfectly well sit ABOVE a shape that persists from the
 * outgoing one.
 *
 * When it does, the flat overlay hides it for the whole transition. Issue #146
 * is exactly that: the wheel deck's centre disc (`!!Content`) is unchanged
 * between the two slides, so its ghost is painted opaque for the full duration,
 * and the title, body and button dissolving in INSIDE that disc were invisible
 * until the overlay was torn down - the new wording appeared in a single frame
 * at the end instead of cross-dissolving with the old.
 *
 * This module decides which incoming shapes have to be lifted into the overlay
 * as well, by ranking both slides' shapes in one merged z-order and - because
 * a travelling ghost composites at the layer the INCOMING slide gives its
 * counterpart, not at the layer the outgoing slide gave the pair - by the
 * incoming slide's own stacking too.

/**
 * The incoming shapes the overlay has to paint over its ghosts.
 *
 * An arriving shape is lifted when a ghost that HOLDS ITS OPACITY sits below it
 * in the merged order and covers it: on the live stage it would dissolve in
 * underneath something opaque and never be seen at all. Anything the ghosts are
 * legitimately on top of - the incoming slide's own backdrop, artwork the
 * persisting shapes are drawn over - keeps its place on the stage.
 *
 * A ghost that DISSOLVES is deliberately not counted, which is why the caller
 * passes only the holding ones. It stops hiding anything within the first
 * quarter of the morph, well before an arrival starts to appear at 42% (see
 * `MORPH_FADE_OUT_END_PERCENT` / `MORPH_FADE_IN_START_PERCENT`), so lifting for
 * it buys nothing and moves an animation the live stage should own: issue
 * #131's overview-to-topic hop dissolves the whole centre out and the arriving
 * group in, exactly that way.
 *
 * A matched pair qualifies only when its incoming half DISSOLVES IN, which the
 * caller states in `dissolvingInIds`. A half that is pinned at full strength
 * (anything painting a body, which would go see-through if both halves faded)
 * has to stay under its own ghost, or its dissolve becomes a cut. A half that
 * fades in may be lifted: it then dissolves over its ghost instead of under it,
 * which differs only where the two shapes' own ink overlaps.
 *
 * This is not a corner case. The wheel deck's centre panel keeps an unchanged
 * opaque disc, and the wording inside it is a matched pair once the panels'
 * casts line up (issue #160), so without this the new wording dissolved in
 * behind that disc's ghost and only appeared when the overlay came down: the
 * same defect issue #146 fixed for the unmatched case, reached by a different
 * road.
 *
 * @param outgoing - The outgoing slide's elements, flattened, in document order.
 * @param incoming - The incoming slide's elements, flattened, in document order.
 * @param pairs - The matched pairs.
 * @param holdingGhostIds - The outgoing ids the overlay paints AND keeps opaque
 *   for the whole morph (a painted pair whose appearance did not change).
 * @param dissolvingInIds - Incoming ids of matched pairs whose incoming half
 *   fades in (see `morphPairIncomingFadesIn`). Defaults to none, the behaviour
 *   before matched pairs could be lifted.
 * @returns The ids of the incoming elements to lift, a subset of `incoming`.
