 *
 * An exact half turn has no shorter arc, and PowerPoint's choice there is not
 * a fixed sign: it turns CLOCKWISE when the shape starts anywhere in
 * [90, 270) and ANTI-clockwise otherwise. Measured on PowerPoint 16 by
 * sampling the rendered frames of a half-turn morph, both on the issue #131
 * wheel (0->180 anti, 45->225 anti, 90->270 clock, 135->315 clock, 180->360
 * clock, 270->90 anti) and on a synthetic two-slide deck built for the purpose
 * (0->180 anti, 45->225 anti, 90->270 clock, 270->90 anti), which agrees on
 * every case. Always taking +180 sent the wheel's arrow round the wrong side
 * for the wedge diametrically opposite the one on screen, so one click in
 * seven looked nothing like the others.
