/**
 * The two halves of an in-place cross-dissolve, paired so a binding can
 * composite them the way PowerPoint composites them: ADDITIVELY.
 *
 * ## Why stacking two fades is not a cross-dissolve
 *
 * A morph dissolves a pair by painting the outgoing half at `1 - t` over the
 * incoming half at `t`. With ordinary (source-over) blending that is not the
 * blend PowerPoint performs. Where BOTH halves paint ink on the same pixel the
 * result is
 *
 * ```
 * bg + (1 - t)(A - bg) + t(A' - bg - (1 - t)(A - bg))  =>  1 - t + t^2
 * ```
 *
 * of the way to full strength instead of all the way: 0.75 at the midpoint. The
 * ink dips toward the backdrop exactly where the two halves agree, so glyphs
 * that cross each other during a text dissolve are painted with dark bites
 * taken out of them, and the wording looks like it is deforming.
 *
 * Measured against PowerPoint 16's own render of the wheel deck's slide 7 -> 8
 * (`CreateVideo`, fitted per frame to `c0 * A + c1 * B` over the centre panel):
 * PowerPoint holds `c0 + c1` at 1.000-1.003 for every frame of the transition,
 * while ours summed to 0.963, and pixels where both slides paint a glyph were
 * 34.6/255 too dark on average (worst 54.9). Issue #161.
 *
 * ## The fix
 *
 * Put both halves in one isolated group and blend them with `plus-lighter`,
 * which sums their PREMULTIPLIED contributions: `(1 - t) A + t B`, a true
 * cross-dissolve. The group is what makes it correct - `plus-lighter` against
 * the backdrop at large would also sum the disc, artwork or slide background
 * underneath and paint the non-overlapping half too BRIGHT by `alpha * backdrop`.
 * Isolating the pair keeps the sum to the two halves and then composites that
 * result over the backdrop normally. It is the same construction CSS view
 * transitions use for their default cross-fade.
 *
 * Only a pair whose halves are BOTH painted in the overlay can be grouped: the
 * incoming half of most pairs animates on the live stage, in a different DOM
 * tree, and moving every one of them into the overlay would change the whole
 * transition's z-order (the failure mode issues #144 / #146 came from). The
 * pairs that qualify are the ones the overlay already lifted, which is the case
 * this was reported for - wording dissolving inside an unchanged opaque shape.
