/**
 * Per-run facts a rendered paragraph carries besides its text and CSS: the
 * run's HYPERLINK and its inline EQUATION (framework-agnostic).
 *
 * Both are authored on the run (`a:r > a:rPr > a:hlinkClick` /
 * `a:hlinkMouseOver`, and an `m:oMath` sibling that core stamps onto its own
 * segment), and both need a different ELEMENT around the run - an `<a>` and a
 * MathML host - rather than a different style, which is why they are modelled
 * separately from {@link RunStyle} instead of being folded into it.
 *
 * Before this existed, `buildParagraphs` returned `{ text, style }` only, so a
 * hyperlinked run rendered as plain text in Vue, Svelte and Vanilla (the link
 * was silently dropped) and Angular compensated with a text-prefix walk that
 * re-attached the metadata to shared's runs by matching their characters. This
 * module is that walk's replacement: resolve once, in the builder, for all five.
