/**
 * state-equality.ts: no-op-write guards for the viewer's hot state paths.
 *
 * Every binding keys its reactivity on identity: React compares the state
 * object, Vue triggers on a `ref` assignment, Angular signals notify on
 * `Object.is` mismatch, Svelte invalidates a `$state` assignment, and Vanilla
 * repaints imperatively on each call. So a write that carries NO new
 * information still costs a full render everywhere, and the cost is paid five
 * times over because the write usually originates in shared code.
 *
 * Issue #145 was one instance of that shape: a presenter-console tick that
 * changed nothing still allocated a fresh snapshot (and bumped `sequence`), so
 * nothing downstream could bail out. The helpers here let the shared producers
 * answer "did this actually change?" once, rather than each binding trying to
 * memoise around a value that is new by construction.
 *
 * These are deliberately field-by-field rather than a generic deep-equal: the
 * hot paths run per pointer move and per animation frame, so the comparison has
 * to be cheaper than the render it prevents, and a generic walk over unknown
 * nested data is not.

 * array is a NEW array after any change anywhere in the object, even when its
