/**
 * Per-run advance-width compensation, so the browser breaks lines where
 * PowerPoint breaks them.
 *
 * PowerPoint lays text out with GDI-compatible (hinted) metrics: every glyph
 * advance is snapped to a whole device pixel at 576 DPI, i.e. to 1/8 point,
 * i.e. to 1/6 of a CSS px. The browser uses unrounded fractional advances. The
 * two therefore disagree by up to 1/12 px per glyph, in EITHER direction, and
 * the accumulated disagreement over a line is what decides a knife-edge wrap.
 *
 * Ground truth (PowerPoint COM `TextRange.BoundWidth` over the issue #131 /
 * #149 deck): summing `round(advance * 6) / 6` reproduced all 78 advance-exact
 * measured lines to under 0.001 px, while the browser's own measurement of the
 * same strings ran anywhere from 1.07% narrow to 0.28% wide.
 *
 * That spread is the point. The first attempt at this (issue #131) applied a
 * flat 0.003em to every run, which is roughly the middle of the range: it
 * tipped genuinely-late wraps the right way but pushed every string the browser
 * already measured WIDER than PowerPoint over its column, so short labels that
 * PowerPoint keeps on one line ("Explore solution", "Secure Data Movement")
 * started wrapping (issue #149). No single constant can do this job; the
 * correction has to be derived from the actual characters.
 *
 * So: measure the run, compute the width PowerPoint would have measured, and
 * emit the letter-spacing that closes the gap. Two details decide whether that
 * works or does damage, and both are documented where they are made -
 * `advancesOf` (advances come from prefix differences, never from measuring a
 * character alone) and the clamp in `resolveMetricTrackingPx`.
 *
 * Measured end to end in Chromium, rendered span against COM ground truth: mean
 * error 0.026 px, worst 0.40 px, against 0.53 px / 2.05 px uncompensated. On
 * shaped scripts the correction moves the text by 0.00% (Arabic, CJK) to 0.08%
 * (Devanagari), i.e. nothing visible.

 * letters join, so an isolated glyph measures ~37% wider than the same letter
 * inside a word; Devanagari forms conjuncts (~66%); an emoji ZWJ sequence is
 * one glyph built from several code points (~33%); and even Latin kerns - the

 * itself. Summing isolated advances would hand the grid model a difference that
 * is not a rounding error at all, and letter-spacing would then stretch the run
 * to "correct" it: visibly wrong text, and a worse wrap than the one this set
 * out to fix.
 *
 * Differencing prefixes cannot fail that way. The advances telescope, so they
 * sum to exactly the width the browser will paint, whatever the shaping did.
 * Only their DISTRIBUTION across a ligature or cluster is approximate, and the
