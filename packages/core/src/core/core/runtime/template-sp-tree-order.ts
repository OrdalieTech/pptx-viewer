/**
 * template-sp-tree-order: restore OOXML document order to a slide LAYOUT or
 * slide MASTER shape tree before the save pipeline flushes it.
 *
 * `slide-save-xml-order.ts` fixed this for slides. It could not fix it for the
 * template parts, because those reach the ZIP by a different route: a layout
 * or master is not rebuilt from the typed model on an ordinary save, it is
 * re-serialized straight out of `layoutXmlMap` / `masterXmlMap`. That is
 * usually a virtue (every unmodelled attribute survives verbatim), but it
 * inherits fast-xml-parser's one-array-per-tag storage: a tree authored
 * `pic,grpSp,sp,sp,pic,grpSp,sp` comes back `pic,pic,grpSp,grpSp,sp,sp,sp`,
 * because the object's key order is the order each tag FIRST appeared and
 * every later sibling of that tag joins the earlier bucket.
 *
 * `CT_GroupShape` (S19.3.1.45) is a painter's-algorithm list, so that is a
 * silent restack of the deck's furniture: a connector authored behind a
 * layout's text comes back in front of it, on every slide using that layout,
 * from a no-edit open-and-save. It was measured on 31 template parts across
 * seven corpus decks.
 *
 * Two order sources, one application point (the flush):
 *
 * - **Passthrough.** The parsed nodes are the ones the loader read, so the
 *   original part XML still describes them: `scanSpTreeDocumentOrder` reads
 *   the authored sequence back off it, groups included, and the refs resolve
 *   against the cached object by array position.
 * - **Rewritten.** When the Slide Master view actually edited a part,
 *   `PptxHandlerRuntimeSaveMasterElements` rebuilds the tree from
 *   `PptxElement[]`; those nodes are new, so it stamps them through
 *   `SpTreeChildOrderTracker` and records the positions here instead. Its
 *   groups are already emitted in order by `appendGroupChildren`, so only the
 *   top level needs re-interleaving on that route.
 *
 * The ordering is applied to a shallow CLONE of the spine, exactly as the
 * slide side does, so the `#pptx-order-N` marker keys live only for the
 * duration of one `builder.build` call and never leak into the cached part
 * map, where a second save or any tag-keyed reader would mis-handle them.
