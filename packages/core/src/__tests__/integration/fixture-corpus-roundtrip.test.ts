/**
 * The corpus-wide load -> save -> reload -> validate harness.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * Eight defects that made PowerPoint refuse to open a saved deck shipped under
 * a green suite because no test ever opened a saved file. Every one of them is
 * visible from a plain no-edit round trip of a real deck, and every one of them
 * is invisible to a model-level assertion, because re-parsing our own output
 * forgives the damage. This harness runs that round trip over EVERY deck in
 * `fixture-corpus-manifest.ts` and asserts, per fixture:
 *
 *   1. the saved package still opens through our own loader;
 *   2. the part list is preserved (allowed losses are declared per fixture);
 *   3. per-slide element counts are stable;
 *   4. every XML part in the output is well-formed;
 *   5. `validatePptx` reports no new errors, and none at all on a deck that
 *      was clean going in.
 *
 * ## Running it
 *
 *     bun run --filter pptx-viewer-core test -- fixture-corpus-roundtrip
 *
 * A full pass is roughly 30 seconds; the whole binary corpus is 130 MB.
 *
 * ## PowerPoint acceptance
 *
 * Passing here is necessary, not sufficient: our loader is more forgiving than
 * PowerPoint's. `scripts/com-acceptance.mjs` drives the real application over
 * the same manifest and is the ground truth. It is deliberately NOT part of
 * `bun run test`, because it needs a local PowerPoint install. Run it after any
 * change to the save pipeline:
 *
 *     bun run scripts/com-acceptance.mjs
 *
 * @see fixture-corpus-manifest.ts for provenance and the accepted deviations.
 * @see save-invariants.test.ts for the specific corruption classes this repo
 *      has already shipped once.
