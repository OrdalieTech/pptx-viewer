/**
 * The registry of every binary presentation fixture in this repository.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Eight defects that made PowerPoint refuse to open a saved deck shipped under
 * a green suite, across 82 e2e specs and three CI shards, because **nothing
 * ever opened a saved file**. Of 58 files named `*roundtrip*` in
 * `src/__tests__/integration/`, exactly one fed genuine PowerPoint output
 * through a full load -> save -> reload cycle; the rest hand-built the XML they
 * then asserted on, so they only proved the code round-trips its own
 * assumptions.
 *
 * `fixture-corpus-roundtrip.test.ts` closes that hole by running every deck
 * listed here through a real cycle. This file is the part a human maintains:
 * where each deck came from, whether it is trustworthy as ground truth, and
 * which deviations from a perfect round trip are accepted rather than
 * accidental.
 *
 * ## The presence guard
 *
 * The harness asserts that the manifest and the directory listings agree
 * EXACTLY, in both directions. A fixture that is deleted, renamed or moved
 * fails the suite loudly instead of quietly reducing coverage, and a fixture
 * added without a manifest entry fails too, so new decks cannot slip in
 * unclassified. This replaces the `it.skipIf(!existsSync(fixture))` pattern,
 * which passes green when its fixture is gone.
 *
 * ## Choosing a deck to reproduce a defect with
 *
 * Prefer a SMALL GENUINE deck. Size is not fidelity: a media-slimmed 726 KB
 * deck reproduced more defects than an 8 MB one, because what matters is the
 * variety of markup, not the weight of the media. Provenance is not optional
 * either - a `synthetic` deck is our own serializer's output fed back to our
 * own parser, so it cannot witness a disagreement between us and PowerPoint.
 * Use `genuineFixtures()` when you need ground truth.
