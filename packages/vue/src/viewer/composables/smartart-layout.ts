/**
 * Thin re-export shim → `pptx-viewer-shared`.
 *
 * The SmartArt SVG-fallback layout engine was consolidated into
 * `pptx-viewer-shared` (`render/smartart-layout*.ts`), shared by every binding.
 * This module was the most complete of the three bindings (10 families) and
 * became the canonical engine. This shim preserves the historical Vue import
 * surface (geometry types + per-family computers + `computeSmartArtLayout`) so
 * `SmartArtRenderer.vue` and the colocated test keep importing the same names
 * unchanged.
