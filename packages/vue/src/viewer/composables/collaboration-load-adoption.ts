/**
 * collaboration-load-adoption.ts: re-adopt the shared doc's slides after a
 * local content load completes mid-session.
 *
 * The content-load pipeline parses asynchronously and assigns its slides
 * unconditionally when done. A late joiner's bootstrap deck can therefore
 * finish parsing AFTER the room's real slides arrived over the doc sync and
 * silently clobber them; with the Y.Doc itself unchanged afterwards, the doc
 * observer never re-fires, so the bootstrap deck would stick until a remote
 * edit. Watching the host's load-version counter closes that hole: on every
 * bump, if the room already holds slides they win; an empty room means this
 * client is the seeder and its loaded deck stands.
