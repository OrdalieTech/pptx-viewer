/**
 * Public component types for the Vue PowerPoint viewer.
 *
 * Ported from the React package's `types-ui.ts`. Two conventions differ
 * from React:
 *
 *  - **Callbacks → emits.** React passed `onDirtyChange`, `onContentChange`,
 *    and `onActiveSlideChange` as function props. The Vue component exposes
 *    these as native events (see {@link PowerPointViewerEmits}); a thin
 *    callback-prop compatibility layer can be added later if needed.
 *  - **Imperative handle → `defineExpose`.** React used `forwardRef` to
 *    surface `getContent()`. The Vue component exposes the same surface via
 *    `defineExpose`, typed by {@link PowerPointViewerExpose}.
 *
 * The framework-agnostic `CanvasSize`, `CollaborationConfig`, and
 * `CollaborationRole` types now live in `pptx-viewer-shared` and are
 * re-exported below for API stability.
