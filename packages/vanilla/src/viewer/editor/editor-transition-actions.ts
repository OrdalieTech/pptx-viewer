 * this only needs to write that same field, history-integrated like every
 * other ribbon mutation.
 *
 * The ribbon's Transitions tab drives `applyTransitionDraft`, built on the
 * shared `ribbon-transitions` decision module, so every control on that tab
 * commits the moment it changes (the matching READ is a plain store read on the
 * chrome side, because the ribbon is built before this editor exists).
 * `applyTransition` is the older
 * single-shot form (type + duration + optional advance fields), kept because it
 * is part of the published `EditActions` surface: when `applyToAll` is true
 * every slide gets the same fresh `{ type, durationMs }` transition; otherwise
 * only the current slide is patched, preserving any advanced fields
 * (direction, sound, ...) it already carried.
