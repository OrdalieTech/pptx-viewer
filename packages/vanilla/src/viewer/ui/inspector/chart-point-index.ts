/**
 * chart-point-index.ts: the "Data Point Index" picker shared by the vanilla
 * chart inspector's advanced and exhaustive sections.
 *
 * WHY it is its own module: both sections author `c:dPt` overrides for ONE
 * point of the selected series (the advanced block owns the point fill and the
 * pie slice explosion, the exhaustive block owns the per-point marker and
 * invert-if-negative), yet only the advanced block owned the index box. The
 * exhaustive block hard-wired `dataPoints[0]`, so the box looked decorative:
 * every marker override landed on the first point no matter what the user
 * typed. Hoisting the field here lets both sections read one selection, which
 * is also what React/Vue/Angular/Svelte give the user, they just spell it as a
 * row per category rather than a number box.
 *
 * The value shown is 1-based because PowerPoint numbers points from 1;
 * {@link ChartPointIndexField.selected} converts to the 0-based SOURCE index,
 * which is the `c:idx` a `c:dPt` carries and the key
 * `resolveDataPointMarker` in `pptx-viewer-shared` looks up when painting.
 *
 * {@link ChartPointIndexField.setSelected} lets `chart-section.ts` drive the
 * box from an on-canvas mark click (`ElementRenderContext.chartPartSelection`
 * by way of `InspectorState.chartHighlightCell`), so pressing a bar on the
 * canvas points every `c:dPt` control here at the SAME point without the user
 * re-typing its index.
