 * Opening and tearing down the Selection Pane.

 * Its own module for the same two reasons as `outline-workflow`:
 * `parity-workflows` is at the repo's file-size ceiling, and this pane owns a
 * live store subscription that has to be released. The subscription is what
 * makes the pane track the deck: it used to be a snapshot taken when it opened,
 * so an undone rename left the new name on screen while the model had already
 * gone back.
 *
 * The host shape is declared structurally rather than importing
 * `ParityWorkflowHost`, which keeps the dependency one-way.
