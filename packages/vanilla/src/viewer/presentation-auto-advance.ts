/**
 * PowerPoint's "Advance slide: After <n>" timing (`p:transition/@advTm`) for a
 * running slide show.
 *
 * A slide authored `advClick="0" advTm="…"` ("on mouse click" OFF, "after N"
 * ON) is advanced ONLY by this timer: `isSwipeAdvanceBlocked` correctly
 * swallows every click and tap on it. Honouring that gate without arming the
 * timer strands the entire show on such a slide with no response to any input,
 * which reads as a slide show that does nothing at all rather than as one stuck
 * slide.
 *
 * The delay comes from the shared `resolveAutoAdvanceDelayMs`, so the vanilla
 * binding advances a deck at exactly the moment every other binding does.
