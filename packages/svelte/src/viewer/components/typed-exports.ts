/**
 * Explicitly-typed public exports of the standalone view components.
 *
 * Same rationale as `PowerPointViewer` in `../component.ts`: `svelte-check`
 * types `.svelte` imports precisely, but the plain TypeScript pass that emits
 * the published declaration files resolves `.svelte` modules through a loose
 * ambient shim (`src/shims-svelte.d.ts`), and the post-build Rollup
 * declaration bundling cannot resolve a raw `.svelte` specifier at all (no
 * `.svelte.d.ts` is emitted, which broke the library build on CI). Re-export
 * through annotated constants so the published `.d.ts` is fully typed and
 * free of `.svelte` specifiers.
