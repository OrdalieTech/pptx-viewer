/**
 * What a stage pointer-down means for the table cell range.
 *
 * Lives beside the selection model rather than inside `TableView.svelte` so the
 * SFC stays presentation-only (it renders the highlight, it does not decide it)
 * and so the rule is unit-testable without mounting a component. The cell
 * coordinates are read back off the `data-cell-row` / `data-cell-col`
 * attributes `TableView` already stamps, which is also how the context menu
 * finds its target: merge-absorbed cells are not rendered, so a cell's DOM
 * position is not its model position and the attributes are the only truth.
 *
 * The RULE itself (extend / anchor / clear) is `tableCellPointerIntent` in
 * `pptx-viewer-shared`; this module only supplies the facts and applies the
 * verdict to the Svelte editor state. Vue was missing the same rule entirely,
 * which is why block merge was unreachable there.

 * hit the stage's Shift branch and toggle the table out of the element
 * selection, which is the opposite of extending a range inside it.
