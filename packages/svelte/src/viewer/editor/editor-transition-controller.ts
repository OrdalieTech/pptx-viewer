 * reads `PptxSlide.transition` (see `presentation/presentation-controller.svelte.ts`),
 * so this only needs to write that same field, routed through
 * `EditorState.commitSlides` so it is history-integrated (undoable).
 *
 * `applyTransition` covers both the preset gallery buttons and the duration
 * input (the tab re-applies the currently-selected preset whenever the
 * duration changes), plus the "Apply to All Slides" checkbox: when
 * `applyToAll` is true every slide gets the same fresh `{ type, durationMs }`
 * transition; otherwise only the current slide is patched, preserving any
 * advanced fields (direction, sound, ...) it already carried.
