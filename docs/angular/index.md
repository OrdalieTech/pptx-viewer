# Angular Viewer Overview

`pptx-angular-viewer` is an **Angular 19-22** standalone component (`<pptx-viewer>`) for rendering
and editing `.pptx` files. It is built on [`pptx-viewer-core`](/core/) and includes the ribbon
toolbar, inspector panels, slide canvas, animation engine, presentation mode, real-time
collaboration, and export. It is the Angular
counterpart of `pptx-react-viewer` and `pptx-vue-viewer`, sharing framework-agnostic logic with both
through the internal `pptx-viewer-shared` package.

## What it provides

| Capability         | Summary                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Viewer**         | Renders slides with 16 element types (shapes, text, images, tables, charts, SmartArt, connectors, media, ink, OLE, 3D models, zoom).            |
| **WYSIWYG editor** | Insert / move / resize / delete elements, inline text editing, style editing, slide management - gated behind `canEdit`.                        |
| **Presenter**      | Fullscreen slideshow with animation playback, transitions, speaker notes, presenter view with timer, and a mobile presenter layout.             |
| **Export**         | PNG / PDF / GIF / WebM video slide export, print, plus Save As `.pptx`. See [Export](/angular/export).                                          |
| **Collaboration**  | Real-time multi-user editing via Yjs CRDT with presence tracking, remote cursors, and follow mode. See [Collaboration](/angular/collaboration). |

## Installation

```bash
npm i pptx-angular-viewer
```

The core engine (`pptx-viewer-core`) is **bundled in**, so you don't install it separately.

**Peer dependencies** (you provide these in your app):

- `@angular/core` and `@angular/common`, matched to each other, on any of ^19 / ^20 / ^21 / ^22
- `rxjs` ^7
- `@ngx-translate/core` ^18

::: info Why 19 is the floor
The package is built with the newest Angular but published as partial (linkable) declarations, so
the real floor is whatever those declarations demand plus the runtime behaviour the source assumes.
Two v19 defaults set it: components are standalone without `standalone: true`, and `effect()` bodies
write signals without `allowSignalWrites`. Both were introduced as defaults in Angular 19. A CI test
re-derives the linker floor from the built bundle on every run, so it cannot drift silently.
:::

**Optional peer dependencies** (only needed for specific features):

- `three` - GLB/GLTF 3D models and the opt-in 3D SmartArt renderer
- `yjs` plus `y-websocket` (server-based) or `y-webrtc` (serverless peer-to-peer) - real-time
  collaboration

::: tip
3D and collaboration features degrade gracefully. Without `three`, 3D models fall back to their
poster image. Without `yjs`/`y-websocket`/`y-webrtc`, the viewer runs in single-user mode.
:::

## Import paths

Unlike React (`pptx-react-viewer` + `pptx-react-viewer/viewer`), Angular's ng-packagr build produces
a **single entry point**: everything is imported from the package root.

```ts
import { PowerPointViewerComponent } from 'pptx-angular-viewer';
```

The `./styles` subpath exports the bundled stylesheet (see [Getting Started](/angular/getting-started)),
and that is the only other export map entry - there is no separate `/viewer` or `/i18n` subpath the
way React and Vue have. `translationsEn`, `keyToLabel`, theme utilities, and every other named export
all live at the package root; see [Localization](/guide/localization) for the i18n specifics.

## Rendering philosophy: CSS, not Canvas

Slides are rendered with **CSS positioning and transforms** (scaled HTML/SVG), not an HTML Canvas.
This provides:

- Crisp text at any zoom level
- Native browser text selection and accessibility
- DOM-based interaction (click, drag, resize hit-testing)
- Standard CSS effects (shadows, gradients, borders)

The tradeoff is that some visual effects are approximated (`backdrop-filter`, `mix-blend-mode`, CSS
3D, path gradients). Raster export goes through `html2canvas-pro`, which has its own constraints. The
full list lives in [Limitations](/guide/limitations).

## Internal architecture: services and standalone components

`PowerPointViewerComponent` is a thin, `OnPush`, signal-driven orchestrator. Its logic is decomposed
into roughly four dozen `@Injectable` orchestration services (provided on the component and wired
together with `inject()` and a `bind()` handoff pattern) plus 200+ standalone child components and
pure helper functions, mirroring React's 80+ internal hooks and Vue's composables. Most of these are
internal architecture, but a curated subset is re-exported from the package root for building custom
UI around the viewer. See [Services](/angular/services) for which are public API.
