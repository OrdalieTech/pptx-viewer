# Vue Viewer Overview

`pptx-vue-viewer` is a **Vue 3** component for rendering and editing `.pptx` files. It is built
on [`pptx-viewer-core`](/core/) and includes the toolbar, inspector panels, slide canvas,
animation engine, presentation mode, real-time collaboration, and export. It is a `<script setup>`
port of the [React viewer](/react/), sharing the same underlying architecture and the same
`PowerPointViewerAPI` contract.

## What it provides

| Capability         | Summary                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Viewer**         | Renders slides with 16 element types (shapes, text, images, tables, 23 chart types, SmartArt, connectors, media, ink, OLE, 3D models, zoom). |
| **WYSIWYG editor** | Insert / move / resize / delete elements, inline text editing, style editing, slide management, gated behind `canEdit`.                      |
| **Presenter**      | Fullscreen slideshow with animations, transitions, speaker notes, presenter view with timer.                                                 |
| **Export**         | PNG / SVG / PDF / GIF / video / JSON slide export, plus save-as PPTX. See [Export](/vue/export).                                             |
| **Collaboration**  | Real-time multi-user editing via Yjs CRDT with presence tracking and remote cursors. See [Collaboration](/vue/collaboration).                |

## Installation

```bash
npm i pptx-vue-viewer
```

The core engine (`pptx-viewer-core`) is **bundled in**, so you don't install it separately; add it
only if you also want to use the framework-agnostic engine directly.

**Peer dependencies** (you provide these in your app):

- `vue` ^3.5
- `vue-i18n` ^11
- `jszip`, `fast-xml-parser`

**Optional dependencies** (only needed for specific features):

- `three` - GLB/GLTF 3D models and 3D surface charts
- `yjs`, `y-websocket` - real-time collaboration (relay transport)
- `y-webrtc` - serverless peer-to-peer collaboration

::: tip
3D and collaboration features degrade gracefully. Without `three`, 3D models fall back to their
poster image. Without `yjs`/`y-websocket`, the viewer runs in single-user mode.

## Import paths

The package exposes several entry points (from `package.json` `exports`):

```ts
// Root entry - viewer, theme utilities, i18n helper re-exports
import { PowerPointViewer } from 'pptx-vue-viewer';

// Viewer sub-entry - the component plus renderers and the curated composables
import { PowerPointViewer } from 'pptx-vue-viewer/viewer';

// vue-i18n dictionary (single-brace interpolation, converted from the shared dictionary)
import { translationsEn } from 'pptx-vue-viewer/i18n';

// Bundled stylesheet, for apps that don't already use Tailwind CSS v4
import 'pptx-vue-viewer/styles';
```

Both `.` and `./viewer` export `PowerPointViewer`; `./viewer` additionally exposes the renderer
components and a curated set of composables (see [Composables](/vue/composables)). Use the root
entry for the common case.

## Rendering philosophy: CSS, not Canvas

Slides are rendered with **CSS positioning and transforms** (scaled HTML/SVG), not an HTML Canvas.
This provides:

- Crisp text at any zoom level
- Native browser text selection and accessibility
- DOM-based interaction (click, drag, resize hit-testing)
- Standard CSS effects (shadows, gradients, borders)

The tradeoff is that some visual effects are approximated (`backdrop-filter`, `mix-blend-mode`, CSS
3D, path gradients). Raster export goes through `html2canvas-pro`, which has its own constraints. The
full list lives in [Limitations](/guide/limitations).

## Composables-based architecture

`PowerPointViewer.vue` is a thin `<script setup>` orchestrator. Its logic is decomposed into **70+
custom composables** under `viewer/composables/`, composed inside the component; the visual
components (`.vue` SFCs) are largely presentational. Conventions differ from React by design:

- `forwardRef` handle -> `defineExpose` (see [Imperative Handle](/vue/handle))
- function-prop callbacks -> emits (see [Props](/vue/props))
- React context -> Vue `provide`/`inject` (theme, table-cell editing, SmartArt node editing, etc.)

Most composables are internal architecture, but a curated subset is re-exported from
`pptx-vue-viewer/viewer`. See [Composables](/vue/composables) for which are public API.
