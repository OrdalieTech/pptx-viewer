# React Viewer Overview

`pptx-react-viewer` is a **React 18 or 19** component for rendering and editing `.pptx` files. It is
built on [`pptx-viewer-core`](/core/) and includes the toolbar, inspector panels, slide canvas,
animation engine, presentation mode, real-time collaboration, and export.

## What it provides

| Capability         | Summary                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Viewer**         | Renders slides with 16 element types (shapes, text, images, tables, 23 chart types, SmartArt, connectors, media, ink, OLE, 3D models, zoom).    |
| **WYSIWYG editor** | Insert / move / resize / delete elements, inline text editing, style editing, slide management - gated behind `canEdit`.                        |
| **Presenter**      | Fullscreen slideshow with 39 animation presets and 26 motion paths, 57 transitions (including morph), speaker notes, presenter view with timer. |
| **Export**         | PNG / SVG / PDF / GIF / video / JSON slide export, plus save-as PPTX. See [Export](/react/export).                                              |
| **Collaboration**  | Real-time multi-user editing via Yjs CRDT with presence tracking, remote cursors, and avatars. See [Collaboration](/react/collaboration).       |

## Installation

```bash
npm i pptx-react-viewer
```

The core engine (`pptx-viewer-core`) is **bundled in**, so you don't install it separately; add it
only if you also want to use the framework-agnostic engine directly.

**Peer dependencies** (you provide these in your app):

- `react` and `react-dom` ^18.2 or ^19 (both majors are covered by their own CI test run)
- `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `react-icons`
- `jspdf`, `jszip`, `fast-xml-parser`
- `i18next`, `react-i18next`

**Optional dependencies** (only needed for specific features):

- `three` - GLB/GLTF 3D models and 3D surface charts
- `yjs`, `y-websocket` - real-time collaboration (relay transport)
- `y-webrtc` - serverless peer-to-peer collaboration

::: tip
3D and collaboration features degrade gracefully. Without `three`, 3D models fall back to their
poster image. Without `yjs`/`y-websocket`, the viewer runs in single-user mode.

## Import paths

The package exposes two entry points (from `package.json` `exports`):

```tsx
// Root entry - viewer, theme utilities, renderToCanvas
import { PowerPointViewer } from 'pptx-react-viewer';

// Viewer sub-entry - same component PLUS the opt-in hooks/components surface
import { PowerPointViewer } from 'pptx-react-viewer/viewer';
```

Both entries export `PowerPointViewer`. The `pptx-react-viewer/viewer` entry additionally exposes the
opt-in, tree-shakeable hooks and collaboration components (see [Hooks](/react/hooks)). Use the root
entry for the common case.

## Rendering philosophy: CSS, not Canvas

Slides are rendered with **CSS positioning and transforms** (scaled HTML/SVG), not an HTML Canvas.
This provides:

- Crisp text at any zoom level
- Native browser text selection and accessibility
- DOM-based interaction (click, drag, resize hit-testing)
- Standard CSS effects (shadows, gradients, borders)

The tradeoff is that some visual effects are approximated (`backdrop-filter`, `mix-blend-mode`, CSS
3D, path gradients). Raster export goes through `html2canvas`, which has its own constraints. The
full list lives in [Limitations](/guide/limitations).

## Hooks-based architecture

The component is a `forwardRef` orchestrator. Its logic is decomposed into **80+ custom hooks**
composed inside `PowerPointViewer.tsx`; the visual components are almost purely presentational. Most
hooks are internal architecture, but a curated, tree-shakeable subset is exported from
`pptx-react-viewer/viewer` for advanced integrations. See [Hooks](/react/hooks) for which are public API.
