# Editing Slides

This page covers changing the content of a presentation: working with elements, formatting, arranging, managing slides, and keeping your work safe.

::: warning Editing must be enabled
Editing is only available when the app is configured for it. If the toolbar shows a **Read-only** badge and you cannot select or move elements, the app is in view-only mode. Developers: see the [Component Props](/react/props) docs.
:::

## Selecting elements

- **Click** an element on the canvas to select it. Handles appear around it.
- **Shift-click** more elements to add them to the selection.
- **Drag on empty canvas** to draw a marquee box and select everything inside it.
- Press **Ctrl+A** (Cmd on macOS) to select every element on the slide.
- Press **Escape** to deselect.

You can also select from the inspector's **Elements** tab, which lists every element on the slide in stacking order under the heading **Layer Order**. This is handy when elements overlap.

## Moving, resizing, and rotating

With an element selected:

- **Move** - drag it. Alignment guides and snap lines appear as it lines up with the grid or other shapes.
- **Nudge** - press the **arrow keys** for small steps, **Shift + arrow keys** for larger steps.
- **Resize** - drag any corner or edge handle.
- **Rotate** - drag the rotation handle above the element. Hold **Shift** while rotating to snap to 15 degree steps.
- **Adjust shape** - some shapes show an extra adjust handle that changes their geometry (for example an arrow's head size).

![Dragging and resizing elements](/user-guide/editing-drag-resize.gif)

For exact placement, open the inspector's **Properties** tab. The **Element** card has **X**, **Y**, **W**, and **H** fields, plus a lock toggle that protects the element from accidental drags.

::: tip Rulers, grid, and guides
Turn on **Rulers**, **Grid**, **Guides**, and **Snap to grid** from the **View** tab's Show group. Drag a guide to reposition it; double-click a guide to remove it.
:::

## Editing text

1. **Double-click** a text box, shape, or table cell. A cursor appears and you can type.
2. Press **Ctrl+Enter** to commit the edit, or **Escape** to cancel it.

![Inline text editing with cursor active](/user-guide/editing-inline-text.jpg)

Format text from the **Home** tab:

- **Font group** - font family and size dropdowns; **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, **Strikethrough**; **Text Shadow**; **Increase / Decrease Font Size**; **Clear Formatting**; **Character Spacing**; **Change Case**; **Font Color** and **Text Highlight Color** (each with preset swatches and a **Custom colour...** picker).

  The font list is grouped the way PowerPoint groups it: the presentation's two
  **theme fonts** first (marked _Headings_ and _Body_), then any fonts
  **embedded in this presentation**, then any you have
  [added this session](#adding-a-font-the-viewer-does-not-have), then the full
  alphabetical list. With nothing overriding it on the selected element, the box
  shows the font the deck would actually render, which inside a title
  placeholder is the theme's heading font rather than a generic default.

- **Paragraph group** - bullet and numbered lists; indent controls; **Align left / center / right / Justify**; **Line Spacing**; **Text Direction** (horizontal, rotated, stacked); **Columns**.

The same text settings are available in the inspector's **Text** panel when a text element is selected.

## Inserting elements

Use the **Insert** tab to add content to the current slide:

| **Action**          | An action button (navigation arrows, home, and similar presets).                                                                      |
| **Field**           | A dynamic field: **Slide Number**, **Date/Time**, **Header**, or **Footer**.                                                          |
| **Header & Footer** | Opens the header and footer dialog for the deck.                                                                                      |

New elements land on the slide selected and ready to move, resize, and style.

![Shapes on a slide](/docs-shots/shapes-slide.jpg)

There is also a **Draw** tab with freehand tools: **Select**, **Pen**, **Highlighter**, **Eraser**, and **Freeform**, plus a pen colour picker and stroke width slider. Ink you draw becomes elements on the slide.

## Formatting with the inspector

The inspector's **Properties** tab changes with the selection:

| When you select...   | You can change...                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nothing (the slide)  | Presentation info, theme, slide size, slide transition, and background (colour or image). |
| A shape or connector | Position, size, rotation, fill (solid, gradient, pattern, image), and stroke.             |
| A text element       | Font, size, colour, alignment, and spacing.                                               |
| An image             | Crop and picture adjustments.                                                             |

| Media                | Playback settings.                                                                        |

### Editing charts on the canvas

Charts are directly editable without leaving the slide:

- **Hover** a mark to see its value in a tooltip.
- **Click** a bar, point, or slice to select it; the matching cell highlights in the inspector's data grid.
- **Drag** a bar or point up or down to change its value (bar, line, area, scatter, and bubble charts). A badge shows the value while you drag; release to commit or press **Escape** to cancel.
- **Double-click the chart title** to rename it in place.

Pie, doughnut, radar, and stacked/percent-stacked marks are click-to-select; edit their values in the data grid. Each change is a single undo step. All of this works the same way across every binding (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and vanilla).

### Editing tables

Right-click a table for row and column commands: **Insert Row Above / Below**, **Insert Column Left / Right**, **Delete Row**, **Delete Column**, **Merge Cells**, and **Split Cell**. Double-click a cell to edit its text.

![A table on a slide](/docs-shots/table-slide.jpg)

## Arranging elements

![Arrange controls in the ribbon](/user-guide/editing-arrange-tab.jpg)

- **Stacking order** - right-click an element and choose **Bring Forward**, **Send Backward**, **Bring to Front**, or **Send to Back**. The same commands are in the Home tab's Drawing group under **Arrange**, and as layer buttons in the inspector.
- **Align and distribute** - with two or more elements selected, use the Home tab's align buttons (left, center, right, top, middle, bottom) and **Distribute** horizontally or vertically.
- **Group / Ungroup** - right-click a multi-selection and choose **Group** so the elements move and resize together; **Ungroup** splits them apart again.
- **Flip** - use **Flip H** / **Flip V** to mirror the selection.

## Managing slides

- **Add a slide** - click **Add Slide** at the bottom of the slides panel, or use **Home > New Slide**. The arrow next to New Slide opens a gallery of the layouts belonging to the current slide's master, each drawn with its real artwork and placeholder frames rather than listed by name. The **Layout** button opens the same gallery to change the current slide's layout, with the layout it is using now outlined. Changing layout moves your content into the matching placeholders; anything the new layout has no slot for stays on the slide as free-standing content rather than being discarded.
- **Reorder** - drag thumbnails in the slides panel, or drag cards in the [slide sorter](/user/viewing#the-slide-sorter).
- **Duplicate, hide, or delete** - open the slide sorter, right-click one or more slides, and choose **Duplicate**, **Hide Slides** / **Show Slides**, or **Delete**. Copy and paste of whole slides works there too (**Ctrl+C** / **Ctrl+V**).
- **Sections** - use **Home > Section** or right-click a thumbnail and choose **Add Section Before** to group slides under named headings. Right-click a section header to **Rename**, **Delete**, or **Move** it.
- **Reset** - **Home > Reset** restores the current slide's placeholder positions from its layout.

## Adding a font the viewer does not have

Presentations sometimes use fonts that are not installed on your device. The
viewer substitutes the closest available face, which can change how the deck
looks. If you have the font file, you can hand it to the viewer for the current
session:

1. Open **File > Options > General** and find the **Fonts** section.
2. Turn on **Let me add font files to this session**. The setting is off by
   default, so the file picker stays disabled until you enable it.
3. Click **Add font file** and choose a `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, or `.woff2`
   file.

The family appears under **Fonts added this session** and in the Home tab's font
list, and slides using it re-render with the real face. Files whose names spell
out a weight or style (`Inter-SemiBoldItalic.woff2`) register under the family
name alone, so the four files of one family combine into a single entry that the
**Bold** and _Italic_ buttons work against.

Added fonts are held in memory only. They are never uploaded, never written into
the presentation, and are discarded when you reload the page, so a licensed font
file stays where you put it. To ship a font _with_ the deck instead, use
**File > Embed Fonts**.

## Editing speaker notes

Open the notes panel with the **Notes** button in the status bar and type. The notes toolbar offers **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, **Strikethrough**, bullet and numbered lists, indent controls, and link insertion, plus a toggle between the rich and plain text editor. Notes are saved with the presentation and appear in [presenter view](/user/presenting#presenter-view).

## Find and replace

1. Press **Ctrl+F**, or use **Home > Editing > Find** / **Replace**.
2. Type the text to find. The **x of y** counter shows matches across all slides; step through them with the previous / next buttons.
3. Toggle **Match case** if needed.
4. To change text, enter a replacement and click **Replace** or **Replace All**.

## Comments

- To comment on an element, right-click it and choose **Add Comment**; or open the inspector's **Comments** tab and use the **Add Comment** box for the current slide.
- Each thread supports **Reply**, **Edit**, **Resolve** (and **Reopen**), and **Delete**.
- Slides with comments show a comment badge on their thumbnail. The **Review** tab's **Comments** button toggles the panel.

## Undo and redo

- **Undo** - **Ctrl+Z**, or the arrow button in the title bar.
- **Redo** - **Ctrl+Shift+Z** or **Ctrl+Y**.

Every edit is captured as a step you can walk backward and forward through. Continuous actions such as dragging count as one step.

## Cut, copy, paste, duplicate

| Action    | Shortcut                    |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Copy      | **Ctrl+C**                  |
| Cut       | **Ctrl+X**                  |
| Paste     | **Ctrl+V**                  |
| Duplicate | **Ctrl+D**                  |
| Delete    | **Delete** or **Backspace** |

The same commands appear when you right-click an element. See the full list on the [Keyboard Shortcuts](/user/shortcuts) page.

## Autosave and recovery

- The **AutoSave** switch in the title bar turns periodic snapshots on or off. When on, the app saves a recovery copy of your work to the browser's local storage every couple of minutes while there are unsaved changes.
- The status bar shows the current state: **Unsaved changes**, **Saving...**, **Saved [time]**, or **All saved**.
- If you close the tab with unsaved changes and come back, a banner titled **Unsaved changes recovered** offers **Restore** and **Dismiss**.
- **Version History** (in the **"..."** overflow menu) lists the stored recovery snapshot with its time and size, and lets you restore or delete it.

::: warning Autosave is not a file save
Autosave keeps a recovery copy inside your browser only. To produce an actual `.pptx` file, use the **Save** button in the title bar or **File > Save**; the file downloads to your device. See [Exporting](/user/exporting).
